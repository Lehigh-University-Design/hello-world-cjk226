<h2>Shrubs are cool! </h2>
<h3>A shrub is a medium-sized woody plant distinguished from a tree by its multiple stems branching out near the ground. Unlike herbaceous plants with soft stems, shrubs have hard, woody stems that give them a bushy appearance. They can be either deciduous, losing their leaves in the fall, or evergreen, maintaining their foliage year-round. Shrubs serve many purposes in landscaping, including creating hedges, filling garden spaces, and providing food and habitat for wildlife.</h3>
